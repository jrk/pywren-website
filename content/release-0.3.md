Summary: Annoucing PyWren 0.3, with region-specific runtimes, better error handling, and a storage API

Today we're excited to release PyWren version 0.3. This release contains
a number of important bug fixes, as we move towards some exciting
new capabilities in 0.4. 

The latest version is installable via:
```
pip install --upgrade pywren
```

And remember to redeploy your pywren function to AWS with 
```
pywren deploy_lambda
```

## Major Changes
- switched to using region-specific runtimes with sharding
- refactored storage API for future support of other cloud providers
- support for python 3.4
- better error handling
- Developer stuff: APL2 license, using pylint on commit.
